# Guidelines for the "Vibe Coders"

---

## 1. Introduction to Vibe Coding

Vibe coding is an innovative approach that harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate software development, particularly for creating Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and prototypes. An MVP is a basic product version with just enough features to attract early users and gather feedback. For zero-to-one stage startups, vibe coding offers significant advantages: it reduces development time, lowers costs, and enables rapid idea validation. A [McKinsey study](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai) found that developers using generative AI can complete tasks up to twice as fast, and a [Microsoft study](https://www.intelligenic.ai/articles/cost-reduction-in-software-development-the-benefits-of-an-ai-driven-sdlc) reported 50% productivity gains with tools like GitHub Copilot. These gains suggest potential cost reductions, though exact savings vary by project.

### When to Use Vibe Coding

Vibe coding excels in scenarios prioritizing speed and iteration:

- **MVPs and Prototypes**: Quickly test product-market fit.
- **Internal Tools**: Build utilities for team efficiency.
- **Feature Proofs of Concept**: Experiment with new ideas.
- **Non-Production Exploratory Work**: Explore innovative solutions.
- **Educational Demos**: Create learning materials efficiently.

### When Not to Use Vibe Coding

It’s less suitable for:

- **Mission-Critical Systems**: Where failure is unacceptable.
- **High-Security Applications**: Requiring robust protection.
- **High-Uptime Systems**: Needing 99.9%+ availability.
- **High-Throughput Transaction Systems**: Handling large transaction volumes.
- **Regulated Industry Applications**: Subject to strict compliance.

These boundaries, supported by [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/feature/The-promises-and-risks-of-AI-in-software-development), highlight the need for caution due to potential AI-generated code vulnerabilities.

## 2. Setting Up Your Project

A well-defined setup is crucial for vibe coding success, involving clear project scoping, tool selection, and environment configuration.

### Step 1: Define Project Boundaries

Create a **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)** to outline software features and functionalities. The FRD should:

- **Specify Features**: List features with clear numbering (e.g., Feature 1: User Authentication, Module 1.1: Login).
- **Define Scope**: Include in-scope and out-of-scope sections to prevent scope creep.
- **Set Constraints**: Detail limits like API rate limits (e.g., 100 requests/minute), file counts, or code line limits.
- **Plan for Future**: Note potential future enhancements (e.g., adding two-factor authentication).

**Example FRD Snippet**:

| Feature ID | Description | Constraints | Future Enhancements |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1/M1.1 | User Login | <200ms response, 100 req/min | Add OAuth support |  |
| F1/M1.2 | Password Reset | Email rate limit: 5/hour | Add SMS option |  |

### Step 2: Leverage AI to Create the FRD

Use advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) from providers like Anthropic or OpenAI to draft the FRD. Provide a detailed project idea, and the AI can structure requirements. For example:

- **Prompt**: “Create an FRD for a social media analytics tool with data aggregation and basic dashboards, using Next.js and FastAPI.”
- Refine the AI-generated document to ensure accuracy.

### Step 3: Choose a Technology Stack

Select technologies with large user bases and strong AI tool compatibility:

- **Frontend**: Next.js or React for web applications.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for rapid API development.
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) or MongoDB for flexibility.

These choices are popular and well-supported by AI tools like Cursor, which excels with JavaScript and Python, as noted in [Best AI Code Generators](https://www.unite.ai/best-ai-code-generators/).

### Step 4: Select AI Tools and IDEs

Choose AI-powered tools for efficient development:

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: An AI-powered IDE like Cursor, such as those with natural language command support, enhances code generation.
- **AI Models**: Advanced LLMs from Anthropic or OpenAI for high-quality code generation.
- **Supporting Tools**: Snyk for security audits and GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

Research tools to ensure they meet project needs, leveraging free trials where available.

### Step 5: Configure Project Rules

In your AI-powered IDE, set up rules to enforce standards, guided by resources like [Cursor Directory Rules](https://cursor.directory/rules) and [Awesome Cursor Rules](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules):

- **Coding Standards**: Ensure consistent style and error handling.
- **Security Rules**: Enable secrets detection and injection prevention.
- **Version Control**: Require commits after milestones with descriptive messages.

**Example .viberules File**:

```yaml
codegen:
  max_file_size: 300
  test_coverage: required
  error_handling: required
  dependencies:
    whitelist: ["react", "fastapi", "prisma"]
security:
  secrets_detection: enabled
  injection_prevention: strict
version_control:
  commit_after_milestones: true

```

Include third-party service documentation links in IDE settings for easy reference.

### Project Setup Checklist

- [ ]  Define project scope and create FRD.
- [ ]  Select technology stack (e.g., Next.js, FastAPI).
- [ ]  Choose AI tools (e.g., Cursor, advanced LLMs).
- [ ]  Configure project rules in IDE.
- [ ]  Set up version control with Git.

## 3. Planning and Task Management

Effective planning ensures clear priorities and smooth development.

### Step 1: Split Features into Subtasks

Use an AI model to break features into manageable subtasks. For example:

- **Feature**: User Authentication
- **Subtasks**:
    - Implement login endpoint.
    - Set up JWT token generation.
    - Create password reset flow.
    - Write unit tests.

**Prompt**: “Break down the User Authentication feature into subtasks for a FastAPI backend.”

### Step 2: Ensure Comprehensive FRD

Verify the FRD includes:

- **Feature Limits**: E.g., “Login endpoint handles 100 requests/minute.”
- **Future Enhancements**: E.g., “Add biometric authentication in V2.”
- **Technical Constraints**: E.g., “Use PostgreSQL with 10GB storage limit.”

This foresight supports scalability and minimizes rework.

### Step 3: Prioritize Tasks with AI

Share the FRD and subtasks with the AI via your AI-powered IDE’s chat feature to prioritize tasks. For example:

- **Prompt**: “Prioritize User Authentication subtasks to optimize development flow.”
- The AI may suggest starting with the database schema, followed by the login endpoint.

This ensures logical dependency handling.

## 4. Development Workflow

Execute development with a structured workflow to maximize AI benefits.

### Step 1: Reinforce Project Rules

Ensure IDE rules maintain:

- **Code Quality**: Consistent formatting and error handling.
- **Security**: Protection against vulnerabilities.
- **Commits**: Regular commits with descriptive messages.

### Step 2: Build Modules with AI Assistance

For each feature:

- **Write Tests First**: Develop unit and integration tests before coding, following Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- **Instruct AI Clearly**: Use detailed prompts for code generation.

**Example Prompt**:

```markdown
As a backend developer, implement a user registration endpoint in FastAPI that:
- Accepts username, email, and password.
- Validates unique email.
- Hashes password with bcrypt.
- Stores user in PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy.
- Returns user ID on success.
Generate unit tests using pytest.

```

- **Review Code**: Manually verify AI-generated code for correctness and efficiency.

### Step 3: Handle Bugs and Errors

For bugs:

- **Provide Context**: Share error logs with the AI.
- **Include Screenshots**: For UI issues, provide visuals.
- **Prompt AI for Fixes**: E.g., “Fix TypeError in router.py by handling null responses.”

**Example Bug Report**:

```markdown
The login endpoint crashes with a 500 error for invalid credentials. Error log:
[TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable]
Modify to return a 401 status with 'Invalid credentials' message.

```

### Daily Development Checklist
